Sharing some Python code as good neighbors in a civilized society do. 

I will sort this out better but basically it uses Matplotlib to create line graphs and bar charts.

Converts the graphs to SVG images and stores them in a media folder.
I use these SVG images in my colts-by-numbers project Angular Material app. 

Version 1 is mostly manual.

Version 2 will automate collections raw stats from external sites and storing those in a database tool.
The images will be copied and moved to the media folder of the Angular Material app. 
Finally the Angular Material colts-by-numbers will be rebuilt and tested and deployed to heroku cloud. 

All of the upcoming deployment to github will be via a newly built CI/CD pipeline driven by a fully
automated process in Python and it looks like including the new 2nd level token authentication that
our pals here at github have decided to enforce over the summer of 2021.
